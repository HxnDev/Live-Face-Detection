## Requirements:
Following modules need to be installed for it to work properly:
- OpenCV
- Mediapipe

### OpenCV:
OpenCV is a huge open-source library for computer vision, machine learning, and image processing. OpenCV supports a wide variety of programming languages like Python, C++, Java, etc. It can process images and videos to identify objects, faces, or even the handwriting of a human.

It can be installed using "pip install opencv-python"


### Mediapipe:
MediaPipe is a framework for building multimodal (eg. video, audio, any time series data), cross platform (i.e Android, iOS, web, edge devices) applied ML pipelines.

It can be installed using "pip install mediapipe"

## Important Note:
I faced alot of dependency issues throughout this project. Some of the issues and their solutions are as follows:
- autopy not installing: This is because autopy currently doesn't support Python versions above 3.8
- webcam not opening: It was a bug in mediapipe and was fixed in latest python versions

Hence, inorder for the project to run smoothly, you need to degrade the Python version to 3.8

### How to Degrade Python Version:
Follow the following steps:
- Uninstall Python from add/remove programs
- Go to AppData and remove any python folder you see.
- Download Python 3.8 from this link : [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/)
- Install it.
- Open command promt and run "pip" inorder to confirm installation.
- Your Python version has been degraded :)
